    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>Hi, I’m Dario Loi, a 22 year old Computer Science Student at Sapienza University of Rome, I'm currently about
            to start my Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, after graduating with full honors in
            Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence.</p>

        <h5>Quick Bio</h5>

        <p>I was born near Naples, Italy, where I lived until my 2nd year of High School, when I moved to Rome. From a
            young
            age I have always been interested in computers and technology, especially how programming allows you to
            create
            anything you can imagine. I started programming for fun before it was even a subject in school, and I have
            been
            doing it ever since; my first programming language was Visual Basic, but I quickly moved on to C++, which I
            nowadays consider my favorite language. I also used Python as the main language for most of my Bachelor's
            Degree courses, so I am well versed in various data science and machine learning libraries such as Pytorch,
            Pandas and the other usual suspects.</p>
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <h2 id="my-hobbies">My Hobbies</h2>

        <p>Most of my hobbies revolve around music, I play the guitar (both classical and electric) and I am an avid
            music
            listener, my taste spans from classical music to metal and everything in between. I also enjoy playing video
            games, my favorite genres are FPSs and strategy games, especially when they have complex mechanics. I also
            enjoy
            reading Isaac Asiimov's books.</p>

        <br></br>

        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

        <p>I have worked on a few projects, both personal and for college, here are some of them:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dario-loi/Spark">Spark</a> - A simple OpenGL renderer in C++ that I
                worked
                on in
                my free time, to learn more about OpenGL and graphics programming.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/DD-ACSAI/chain-DB">Chain-DB</a> - A C++ CLI application that allows
                management
                of a fictitious logistics company, managing the company's vehicles, drivers and shipments and
                plotting
                courses through the A* algorithm. This was a group project for my Database course.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Barda/mine-to-win">Mine-RCNN</a> - A Python/Pytorch
                re-implementation
                of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497">Faster-RCNN</a> paper, detecting entity
                silhouettes in
                the
                sandbox game Minecraft, for my Deep Learning course.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/random-forest-multicore/MulticoreTree">CUDA Accelerated Decision
                    Trees</a> -
                A C
                implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forest</a>
                algorithm,
                accelerated with CUDA, for my Parallel and Distributed Computing course.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dario-loi/exposure-fusion">Exposure Fusion</a> - An OpenCV2
                implementation
                of
                the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231m/project-1/exposure-fusion.pdf">Exposure
                    Fusion</a>
                algorithm, for my Computer Graphics course, includes homographic alignment between low resolution
                images,
                and works at blazing speeds.</li>
        </ul>
